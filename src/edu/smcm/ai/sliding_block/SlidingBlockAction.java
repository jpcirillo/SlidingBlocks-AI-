/**
 * Actions in the Sliding Block Puzzle.
 * 
 * There are really only four actions in the Sliding Block Puzzle -- slide the
 * tile from the right; slide the tile from the left; slide the tile from above
 * (up) and slide the tile from below (down). A design decision has been made to
 * use an enum to represent the value of the action so that it can be used in
 * switch statements; however this would also have been true if the values had
 * been represented by the more common fixed integer constants. However, this
 * method provides an illustration of the enum class. This class cannot be an
 * enum because an enum cannot extend a class or implement an interface
 * (annoyingly).
